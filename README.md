# VanillaEpochTUGs

## Overview

- This is a rough port of TUG's leveling guide into Zygors for Project Epoch WoW (3.3.5)
- This is **NOT** TUG's project, they allowed me to port their guide as they are not involved in Project Epoch.

The goal of this project is to have a strong leveling base with TUG guide, then to expand it as new quests are discovered.

Important : This is very WIP as Epoch hasn't released yet and this repository is new !

## Contributing

Overall, the plan is to make this project community-based since there is a massive amount of new quests / items added with Project Epoch,
and I will not be able to go through all the content myself so I rely on the Epoch community to suggest routes !

In order to contribute :

- Open an issue in Github (TODO : Add link) in this repository with the changes you think should be made. Each issue should cover 1 change "idea"
  (eg. you can include multiple quest change in 1 zone if they relate to each other in the route. Changes across multiple zones should be split in general).
- If you would like to directly implement the change in the code base, create a pull request (TODO : Add link) linking to an issue.

Please read the guide format [here](./guide_format.html) on how to write Zygor formatted guides (open in your browser).

## Notes

I have very little LUA experience, contributions regarding bugs in the addon itself are very much appreciated !

## Credits

Credits for the original route (and initial port) all go to TUG !
