# VanillaEpochTUGs

## Overview

This is a port of Zygor 3.3.5 addon to Project Epoch, with the following guides :

- Zygor Leveling Guide : Integrated within the addon when ported. This is the most complete leveling guide as it was made specifically for this Addon.
  - All credits go to the original author Zygor !
- Auto generated TUG : Automated port of TUG guide from his google sheet to this addon in the Zygor format. This port is experimental and has not been tested yet.
  - This guide is entirely open source and free (compared to Zygor which is usually paid), all credits go to TUG !
- TUG manual port (max level 36 !) : TUG ported a few of his guides manually to the Zygor addon, these have better integration with Zygor than auto generated ones but only go to level 36 (not everything was tested)

Note : This is **NOT** TUG's project, they allowed me to port their guide as they are not involved in Project Epoch.

The goal of this project is to have a strong leveling base with Zygor / TUG guides, then to expand them as new quests are discovered.

Important : This is very WIP as Epoch hasn't released yet and this repository is quite new !

## Contributing

Overall, the plan is to make this project community-based since there is a massive amount of new quests / items added with Project Epoch,
and I will not be able to go through all the content myself so I rely on the Epoch community to suggest leveling routes !

In order to contribute :

- Open an issue [in Github here](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/VanillaEpochLeveling/issues) with the changes you think should be made. Each issue should cover 1 change "idea"
  (eg. you can include multiple quest change in 1 zone if they relate to each other in the route. Changes across multiple zones should be split in general).
- If you would like to directly implement the change in the code base, create [a pull request](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/VanillaEpochLeveling/pulls) linking to an issue.

Please read the guide format [here](./guide_format.html) on how to write Zygor formatted guides (open in your browser).

## Notes

Issues / contributions regarding bugs in the addon itself are very much appreciated !

## Credits

All credits for the Addon and the base Zygor guide go to Zygor !

Credits for the original TUG route (and initial port) all go to TUG !
